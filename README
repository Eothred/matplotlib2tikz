This is matplotlib2tikz, a Python script for converting matplotlib figures into native
TikZ figures.

To download matplotlibtikz, go to its page on GitHub
http://github.com/nicki/matplotlib2tikz.

The workflow is as follows.

  0.) a) Place the matplotlib2tikz script in a directory where Python can find it
         (e.g., $PYTHONPATH).

     You can install it systemwide with

           sudo python setup.py install

     You can install it for your own user only with

           sudo python setup.py install --prefix=~/.local/

         or place the script matplotlib2tikz.py into the directory where you intend to use it.

      b) Make sure that your LaTeX installation includes the packages

          * TikZ (aka PGF, >=2.00), and
          * Pgfplots (>=1.3).

  1.) Generate your matplotlib plot as usual.

  2.) Instead of pyplot.show(), invoke matplotlib2tikz by

        tikz_save( 'myfile.tikz' );

      to store the TikZ file as myfile.tikz. Load the libary with:

        from matplotlib2tikz import save as tikz_save

      Optional:
      The scripts accepts several options, for example 'height', 'width', 'encoding', and some others. Invoke by

        tikz_save( 'myfile.tikz', figureheight='4cm', figurewidth='6cm' )


      IMPORTANT:
      Height and width must be set large enough; setting it too low it may result in a LaTeX compilation failure such as 
        - Dimension Too Large, or
        - Arithmetic Overflow
      (see information about these errors in the manual of Pgfplots)

      To specify the dimension of the plot from within the LaTeX document, try
        
        tikz_save( 'myfile.tikz', figureheight='\\figureheight', figurewidth='\\figurewidth' )

      and in the LaTeX source
 
        \newlength\figureheight
        \newlength\figurewidth
        \setlength\figureheight{4cm}
        \setlength\figurewidth{6cm}
        \input{myfile.tikz}

  3.) Add the contents of myfile.tikz into your LaTeX source code; a
      convenient way of doing so is to use \input{/path/to/myfile.tikz}.
      Also make sure that at the header of your document the packages TikZ and
      Pgfplots are included:

        \usepackage{tikz}
        \usepackage{pgfplots}

      Optionally, to use features of the latest Pgfplots package (as of Pgfplots 1.3), insert

        \pgfplotsset{compat=newest}
